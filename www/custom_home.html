<h2> Input Data Format</h2>
Comics server expect an Excel file with at least two sheets:  
  <p>
  One, that has the following column headers: <b>"TRAITID1", "TRAITID2" </b>. Users can also include "PVALUE", ["BETA" or "COR"]. "COR" can be the correlation between the two traits. If "PVALUE", ["BETA" or "COR"] are missing in the file, server will use PVALUE = 0.05 and BETA value "1" as default values for the association strength. 
  <p>
  Two, that has the annotation for the TRAITIDs with the following column headers: <b>"TRAITID","SHORTNAME","PLAT" </b>. "PLAT" contains platform information, e.g. OLINK, GWAS, EWAS, MBS (Mutual Best Hits). Platform information is used as the node properties (shape or color) in the network. 

  <p>User can have multiple sheets for traits associations and <b>only one</b> sheet with annotation information.</p>
  
  <p>User can also provide a sheet with <b>shape</b> and <b>color</b> for each platform. If this information is not available, server will allow user to make shape and color selection for each platform.</p>
  
<h4>Basic navigation</h4>
<p> Server starts with <b>Home page</b>.</p>
<p> Under <b>Import Data</b> tab, user can upload their excel file that contains the trait association explained in the section: "Input Data Format". </p>

Once the file is succesfully uploaded to the server, it will display the overview of the file, such as, how many associations, traits, and platforms are found in the input file.
Page will also give an option to:<br><br> 1. customize the network based on "Shape" and "Color" for each platform, and <br> 2. to select/unselect sheet(s) for further processing. <br><br>
Once all the customization options are selected, clicking <b>"Process" </b>button will display the sheets in a clickable "Table" tab. Selecting row(s) and clicking on <b>"Focus Network on Selection" </b> will fetch all the associations for the selected pair in all the available sheets to generate the network. User can save and download the updated excel file based on their shape and color selection in the previous step.
Adjust the "max nodes" pull-down menu to limit the number of maximum nodes
(select '1' to always show only the first degree neighborhood).
<p>

Hover with the mouse over the nodes and edges to display their properties.
<p>

Use the mouse to rearrange the network layout.
<p>
<p> Clicking a node will display the connected associations in the table below the network.</p>

Hint: The pull-down menu "select trait" is searchable. In order to do so, 
hit the backspace key and then start typing (this is a shiny feature).
Use "select platform" to limit the number of items in the "select trait" pull-down menu.
<p>

<h4>Selecting pair-wise associations</h4>
The full set of all association data is available in shiny format in the "Tables" tab and can be searched
using the "Search" text box. Note that there are multipe tab for the different types
of association (GWAS, EWAS, RWAS, MBH, GGM, GENO, CATA, and STAT).
Click on a single association line in one of the table, and then on the button
"Click here to focus network on association ...".
This will display the neighborhoods of the two associated traits.
<p>


<h4>Exporting the displayed network</h4>
Use the "Export" tab to export all data from the current network.
If you want to export the entire comics dataset, you can download the Excel file 
provided on the comics <a href="https://github.com/karstensuhre/comics">comics GitHub page</a>.
The comics server uses this Excel file as input and starting point.
